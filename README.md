Technical test - SwiftUI Demo

This demo application is created using XCode 13.4.1, Swift 5, SwiftUI, iOS 15.0

I tried to take car about quality, even if in a so short time, without any detailed US, 
it is quite easy to create dumb :o(

I added some funny animation (taken from already created personnal projets )

please take car that I added only few unit test, allowing to chekc some func.
this would need more time to make good unit tests.

this project is intented to be run on iPhone, and was not tested on really small device : iphone 5 for example.

for any reason, the wenservice call return an error.
then, I set 2 Schemes : 
one debug, using mock datas ( then, image are coming from Assets in app resources )
one release - using webservice call ( in case of the test server goes on again )

a lot of improvement could be done :
using Viper like pattern
add viewmodifier to simplify some Views
separate in several layers mock and web service calls

Enjoy
